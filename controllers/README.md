# Controller of Control Form

This project was created for learning purposes.

## Before the launch

Go to [Form.js](https://github.com/zayl97/Contact_Form/blob/main/controllers/Form.js) and configure your database credentials. For testing purposes I was using XAMPP to host local server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

You have to run this command to launch database scripts of the app.

### `npm run devStart`

If you will need to run the controller in the dev mode, you can use this command. Thanks to that you will use Nodemon which will automatically relaunch the server after each change in the file.
